# Frontend Interview Questions

There is two types of interview questions for frontend  developer:
questions about CSS and questions about JS (duh).
You need to be good at both of them in order to get job you want.

Beside of that if you're looking for good frontend DS developer you will
want to ask him relevant questions about his field of expertise.
Therefore if you're business owner or senior developer who is looking
for new specialist you need some sort of list of questions in order
to know where to start. Then this collection is also for you.

## Disclaimer

Keep in mind that it is not effective to ask random questions,
even if there are related to the tools your applicant will use.
You need to ask questions that related to **your** *code* and **your** *business needs*.
Otherwise you will hire some random guy with random skills. 
My aim here is only to give you some examples of good interview questions *in general*.
