# JavaScript questions

**Q.** What will be value of `y`?

```javascript
    var y,
        x = 1;
        
    y = x+++x;
```

**A.** `y = 3`

**Explanation** First will be calculated `x++`, it will return `1` and after the value of `x` will be increased by `1`.
Therefore at the end we will have `1 + 2`
