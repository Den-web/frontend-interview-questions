# HTML questions

**Q.** What is doctype, what happens if you don't provide it?

**A.**

HTML5 DOCTYPE declaration, should be the first tag in the source markup of any web page:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

The DOCTYPE, is utilized by the web browser to identify the version of the markup language in which the page is written. It may contain a link to a Document Type Definition, or DTD for short. The DTD sets out the rules and grammar for that flavor of markup, thus enabling the browser to render the content accordingly.

The HTML5 DOCTYPE is the most up-to-date standard, and is the preferred choice for all new documents. It adds support for all the new HTML5 features like sectioning elements, new semantic elements, new form types, new multimedia elements, and a lot of great APIs to extend your web applications.
